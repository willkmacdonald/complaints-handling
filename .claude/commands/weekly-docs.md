Weekly documentation update task.

1. Read current-sprint.md to see what was completed this week
2. Read implementation-plan.md and update:
   - Mark completed PRs as done
   - Add any new discovered tasks
3. Read README.md and update ONLY:
   - "What's New" section (add completed features)
   - "Implementation Status" table
   - Any new API endpoints added

Keep updates minimal - only document what changed, don't rewrite sections.
