The system was provided with: target AUC of 5, patient weight 70kg, height 175cm, serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, age 62, female. The software calculated a recommended dose of 750mg. The clinical pharmacist reviewed the calculation and manually verified using the same formula, obtaining a dose of 450mg. Investigation found the software was incorrectly using the Cockcroft-Gault equation with a male coefficient instead of female, resulting in an overestimated GFR and therefore an overdose recommendation of approximately 67% above the correct dose. The error was caught before administration. IT confirmed the bug exists in v3.2.1 for all female patients.",

A1101 (Application Program Problem) also applies as there's a bug in the application logic. C10 (No Patient Problem) because the error was caught. Despite no actual harm, this REQUIRES MDR because the malfunction could cause serious injury or death if it recurs - a 67% chemotherapy overdose could be fatal. The systematic nature (affects all female patients) makes this particularly serious."
