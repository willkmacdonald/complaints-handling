Based on this reading, patient consumed 15g fast-acting carbs and reduced their dinner insulin dose. Approximately 1 hour later, patient felt symptoms of hyperglycemia and rechecked with a backup meter which showed 245 mg/dL. Patient then tested the original meter with control solution which showed the meter was reading approximately 100 mg/dL low. The patient's actual glucose at the time of the original reading was likely around 150 mg/dL, not 52 mg/dL.
