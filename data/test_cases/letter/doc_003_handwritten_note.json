Model # QS-200. On March 8th I was walking to my mailbox and the left crutch just snapped! The bottom part where it adjusts broke clean off.\n\nI fell on my driveway and broke my wrist (left one). Had to go to ER and get a cast. Attached is a photo of the broken crutch and my ER paperwork.\n\nSerial # is hard to read but looks like QS2-23-78456\n\nI still have the broken crutch if you need it.\n\nPlease call me -\nCarol Fisher\n555-678-2234\n\nP.S. - I am 72 years old and live alone. This was very scary for me.",
