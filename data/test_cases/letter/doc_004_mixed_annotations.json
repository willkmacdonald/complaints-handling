TORRES (HANDWRITTEN):\n===============================================\n\n\"I am formally reporting a complaint about the GlucoAnalyzer 5000 (S/N GA5K-2022-45123). This machine reported glucose of 342 mg/dL for my patient. Based on this result, we initiated aggressive IV insulin therapy for presumed DKA.\n\nPoint-of-care fingerstick done simultaneously showed 185. When I questioned the discrepancy, lab re-ran on backup analyzer - result was 178.\n\nPatient experienced hypoglycemic episode (BG dropped to 45) due to over-treatment based on falsely elevated result. Required D50 push x2. Patient recovered but this could have been fatal.\n\nI have pulled this analyzer from service. Lab lot # GA-2024-Q1-089. This is the THIRD glucose discrepancy I've seen this month on this machine. Please investigate urgently.\n\nDr. Angela Torres, MD\nInternal Medicine\n04/02/2024\nContact: atorres@centralmed.org or (555) 892-7700 x445\"",
