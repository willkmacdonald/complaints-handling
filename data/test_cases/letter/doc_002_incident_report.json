I went to the room and found the ventilator circuit disconnected at the Y-piece. The ventilator low pressure alarm had NOT activated, even though the disconnect had apparently been present for several minutes based on the trending data.\n\nUpon inspection, the ventilator alarm system was set correctly (low pressure alarm at 5 cmH2O). The disconnect should have triggered an immediate alarm. Other nurses confirmed they had not heard any alarm.\n\nI reconnected the circuit and the patient's saturation recovered to 95% within 2 minutes. Physician was notified.\n\n==============================================================================\nPATIENT OUTCOME\n==============================================================================\n[X] No apparent harm\n[ ] Temporary harm requiring intervention\n[ ] Permanent harm\n[ ] Death\n[ ] Unknown at time of report\n\nNotes: Patient SpO2 dropped to 88% but recovered quickly after reconnection. No apparent lasting effects. Patient remains sedated and stable.\n\n==============================================================================\nIMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN\n==============================================================================\n1. Reconnected ventilator circuit\n2. Verified patient stabilization\n3. Notified attending physician (Dr. Raymond Kim)\n4. Tagged ventilator and removed from service\n5. Replacement ventilator obtained from equipment pool\n6. Biomedical engineering notified for device evaluation\n\n==============================================================================\nEQUIPMENT DISPOSITION\n==============================================================================\n[X] Removed from service\n[X] Retained for evaluation\n[ ] Returned to manufacturer\n[ ] Discarded\n\nLocation of device: Biomedical Engineering, Tag #BME-2024-0156\n\n==============================================================================\nAPPROVALS\n==============================================================================\nReporting Nurse: Jennifer Walsh, RN_______ Date: 02/02/2024\nCharge Nurse: Michael Torres, RN_________ Date: 02/02/2024\nRisk Management: Sandra Chen_____________ Date: 02/03/2024",
