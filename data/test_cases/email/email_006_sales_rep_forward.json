    "body": "Team,\n\nForwarding this from my customer at Midwest Kidney Center. This is a large account (12 machines) and they're very concerned. The biomedical engineer is solid - if he says there's an issue, there is.\n\nI've already contacted them to get more details. They have documented 3 separate incidents over the past week with the same model. No patients harmed yet but this sounds serious.\n\nPlease advise how I should respond and whether we need to escalate.\n\nThanks,\nMike Chen\nSenior Sales Representative - Midwest Region\nRenalCare Devices\n(555) 333-2211\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nFrom: Tom Williams <t.williams@midwestkidney.org>\nSent: Friday, April 12, 2024 4:47 PM\nTo: mike.chen@renalcare-devices.com\nSubject: URGENT - Dialysis machine alarm issue\n\nMike,\n\nWe have a serious problem with three of our RenalCare Hemodialysis System 5000 units.\n\nOver the past week, we've had 3 incidents where the air detector alarm failed to activate during treatment. In each case, our nurses caught the air in the line visually during routine monitoring. If they hadn't been paying close attention, air could have been infused into patients.\n\nThe affected units are:\n- S/N RCH5K-2023-11234 (Treatment room 3)\n- S/N RCH5K-2023-11235 (Treatment room 5)  \n- S/N RCH5K-2023-11238 (Treatment room 8)\n\nAll three were installed in September 2023 from the same shipment.\n\nI've taken all three units offline and we're using backup equipment. We need someone here ASAP to investigate. Our clinical director is very concerned and is considering whether we need to report this to the FDA ourselves.\n\nPlease call me first thing Monday.\n\nTom Williams\nDirector of Biomedical Engineering\nMidwest Kidney Center\n(555) 444-5566",
