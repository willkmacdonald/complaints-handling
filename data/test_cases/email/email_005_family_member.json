    "body": "Hello,\n\nI am writing on behalf of my father, William Martinez (age 82), who was injured yesterday when his powered wheelchair malfunctioned.\n\nMy father has been using the MobilityPlus PowerGlide 3000 wheelchair for about 18 months. He has limited mobility due to a stroke he had 3 years ago and relies on the wheelchair to get around his assisted living facility.\n\nYesterday morning (April 9), he was using the wheelchair to go to breakfast when the brakes suddenly engaged while he was moving forward at normal speed. The sudden stop threw him forward out of the chair. He hit his head on the floor and also injured his right wrist trying to catch himself.\n\nThe staff at Sunrise Senior Living called 911 and he was taken to St. Mary's Hospital. He has a concussion and a fractured wrist. He's still in the hospital and they want to keep him for observation because of his age.\n\nThe wheelchair model is PowerGlide 3000, serial number PG3K-2022-56234. It was provided through Medicare in October 2022.\n\nThe facility has kept the wheelchair and said they won't let anyone use it until this is resolved.\n\nI am his healthcare proxy and can provide any additional information you need. Please contact me at this email or call (555) 777-8899.\n\nThank you,\nJennifer Martinez",
