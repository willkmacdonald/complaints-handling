When tested on the practice tissue model, these units did not grip properly and would not have provided adequate tissue purchase during surgery.\n\nThe 4th unit appeared to function correctly.\n\nDr. Ramirez declined to proceed with the evaluation trial and has put further orders on hold pending resolution.\n\nACTION TAKEN:\n- All 4 units retained and sealed in original packaging\n- Labeled with date and issue description\n- Will ship to QA per standard procedure\n- Customer notified we are investigating\n\nIMPACT:\n- No patient exposure\n- Demo evaluation cancelled\n- $50K potential order at risk\n- Customer confidence affected\n\nPlease advise on:\n1. Whether to quarantine other stock from this lot at our distribution centers\n2. Customer communication guidance\n3. Timeline for investigation\n\nSarah Johnson\nSenior Sales Representative\nSurgiTool Medical - Mountain West\nCell: (555) 888-9900",
