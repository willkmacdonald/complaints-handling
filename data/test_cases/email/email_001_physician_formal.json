On February 28, 2024, patient presented with increasing lower back pain, fever (101.2°F), and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 85 mg/L, ESR 72 mm/hr). CT imaging revealed fluid collection adjacent to hardware with possible abscess formation.\n\nCultures obtained via CT-guided aspiration grew Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Despite IV antibiotic therapy (cefazolin), infection failed to resolve. Patient underwent surgical debridement and hardware removal on March 4, 2024.\n\nDevice Disposition:\nRemoved hardware has been retained and is available for manufacturer evaluation if requested.\n\nPlease contact me if you require additional clinical information.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Sarah Chen, MD, FACS\nDepartment of Orthopedic Surgery\nUniversity Hospital Medical Center\nPhone: (555) 234-5678",
