Upon investigation, I found the IV tubing was kinked at the pump loading area, causing a complete occlusion.\n\nThe pump did NOT alarm for occlusion. The infusion history showed the pump had detected \"high pressure\" at 0323 but continued to show \"Infusing\" status. No audible or visual alarm was generated.\n\nThe patient's blood pressure continued to decline for ~20 minutes until I identified the problem during rounds. Norepinephrine was restarted after unkinking the line and patient required a transient increase in dose (to 12 mcg/min) to restore hemodynamic stability.\n\nPATIENT OUTCOME:\nPatient experienced transient hypotension (MAP 55-58 x 20 min) requiring increased vasopressor support. Stabilized without further intervention. No lasting harm identified at this time.\n\nACTION TAKEN:\n1. IV tubing repositioned and infusion restarted\n2. Pump taken out of service and labeled\n3. Incident report filed (IR#2024-0892)\n4. Biomedical engineering notified\n5. Manufacturer notification (this email)\n\nOTHER PUMPS AFFECTED:\nWe have 24 InfuSafe 4000 pumps on this unit. Biomedical is checking all units for software version and alarm function testing.\n\nPLEASE ADVISE:\n- Is this a known issue with software version 4.2.1?\n- Should we take any additional precautions?\n- Will you be sending a field service representative?\n\nAmanda Patel, RN, BSN\nCharge Nurse, Medical ICU\nSt. Mary's Hospital\nDirect: (555) 234-5678 ext 4512\n\ncc: Risk Management, Pharmacy",
