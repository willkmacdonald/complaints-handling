Last week the heating element in the humidifier chamber MALFUNCTIONED and sent SCALDING HOT water vapor into my mask while I was sleeping.\n\nI woke up screaming at 4am with SECOND DEGREE BURNS on my nose and cheeks. I had to go to the emergency room!!! The ER doctor said I have burns that will probably leave permanent scars on my face.\n\nThe machine serial number is SW5K-2023-88901. I bought it from your website in October 2023.\n\nI have photos of my injuries and all the medical records. My wife also witnessed everything.\n\nI want:\n1. A full refund IMMEDIATELY\n2. All my medical bills paid\n3. Someone to call me TODAY to explain how this happened\n4. A guarantee this won't happen to anyone else\n\nIf I don't hear from someone by end of business today, I WILL be contacting my lawyer and the FDA.\n\nI have kept the machine and all packaging as evidence.\n\nRobert Thompson\n(555) 444-3322\n\nP.S. I have already posted about this on three different sleep apnea forums. Other people need to know about this danger.",
