    "body": "Hi,\n\nThe portable echo in our cath lab (the EchoView 3000, S/N EV3K-2022-45678) is showing intermittent signal dropout during Doppler assessment. Started about 2 weeks ago. Getting worse. Already changed cables and cleaned transducer - no improvement.\n\nMissed some critical flow measurements yesterday during a valve case. Luckily we had backup but this needs to be addressed ASAP.\n\nIs this a known issue? Can someone call me tomorrow AM?\n\n-J Miller MD",
