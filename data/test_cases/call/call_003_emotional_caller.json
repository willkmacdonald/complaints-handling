      {"speaker": "caller", "text": "I don't... I can't think straight. It's the kids one, the colorful one. ClearKids something? He picked the blue one because it's his favorite color. [crying] He might have scars, the doctor said."},
      {"speaker": "agent", "text": "That must be the ClearKids Pro. Do you have the hearing aid with you?"},
      {"speaker": "caller", "text": "No, I didn't... I just grabbed my son and ran. My husband is at home, he has it. There's black burn marks all over it. The battery, it just... it was smoking and then there was fire. It melted part of the plastic."},

      {"speaker": "agent", "text": "Was this a new battery or had it been in the device for a while?"},
      {"speaker": "caller", "text": "[sniffling] I put it in yesterday. It was brand new. He's worn hearing aids since he was 4, this has never happened. I don't understand how this could happen. He's just a little kid."},
